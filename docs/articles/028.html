            <h1>Some emotions</h1>
<p>Sorry for these days, I don't have any articles.</p>
<p>Currently, I am writing some apps, but I found that writing is really upsets me. Why? I think I should happy now.
But no, I am just angry, and always ask myself, why? Where's my passionate?</p>
<p>What is strong? What is weak? As a developer, what should I have?
I don't know, I don't know...my level. Maybe I am not even a full <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/">Stack overflow</a> developer.
Self-taught? Is that really good if you just learnt how to print Hello World?</p>
<p>Even you can write your own game engine, you are not enough.</p>
<p>Now, I am not so young, something cannot come back, and something...something disappear.</p>
<p>Looks like everyone besides me are happy.
And I cannot find people that I can trust to tell something.</p>
<p>I am walking on a hard path.
I feel that my ability is going down.
I am abusing my body and my health.</p>
<p>My hobbies, my money, and my habits.</p>
<p>Life sucks.</p>
