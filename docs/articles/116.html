            <h1>ChatGPT</h1>
<p><a href="https://chat.openai.com/chat">ChatGPT</a> is an absorbing app. Its popularity has a reason. One of my favourite things is that it can summarise articles. You really should not treat it as a search engine.</p>
<p>Anyway, I had a conversation with ChatGPT recently. It inspires me and lets me understand what it can do.</p>
<p>Hint: you can use <code>[...document.querySelectorAll(&quot;.items-start&quot;)].map(i=&gt;i.textContent)</code> at the developer console to get texts on the conversation.</p>
<h2>Coversation</h2>
<p><strong>Me:</strong> What does the article said? https://www.twreporter.org/a/opinion-ccp-100-japan-communist-party</p>
<p><strong>ChatGPT:</strong> I'm sorry, but as an AI language model, I am not able to browse the internet or access specific articles without a provided link. Can you please provide me with the URL of the article you are referring to so that I can try to summarize it for you?</p>
<p><strong>Me:</strong> Does &quot;The URL of the article&quot; I am referring to is something like this? https://www.twreporter.org/a/opinion-ccp-100-japan-communist-party</p>
<p><strong>ChatGPT:</strong> Yes, that is the URL for the article you are referring to. The article is titled &quot;The CCP Turns 100: What Japan's Communist Party Can Teach Us About Surviving Repression&quot; and is published on the Taiwan-based news website The Reporter.</p>
<p>The article discusses the 100th anniversary of the founding of the Chinese Communist Party (CCP) and draws comparisons with the experience of the Japanese Communist Party (JCP), which has also faced repression and restrictions on its activities in the past. The article argues that the JCP's ability to survive and maintain its influence in Japanese politics despite repression can provide lessons for those seeking to challenge authoritarian regimes.</p>
<p>The article describes the history of the JCP, including its early years of growth in the 1920s and 1930s, its suppression during World War II, and its post-war rebuilding and transformation into a more moderate, mainstream political party. The article notes that the JCP has faced significant challenges, including censorship, arrests, and violence against its members, but has been able to adapt and survive by building strong grassroots support and finding ways to work within the limits of the political system.</p>
<p>The article also discusses the current state of the CCP and its approach to dissent and repression, arguing that the party's current tactics are not sustainable in the long term and may ultimately lead to its downfall. The article suggests that the CCP could learn from the JCP's experience and adopt a more flexible and adaptive approach to dissent and opposition.</p>
<p><strong>Me:</strong> Interesting. Do you know who's the author of the article? I mean, who wrote the article?</p>
<p><strong>ChatGPT:</strong> The author of the article is Brian Hioe. He is a freelance writer and the editor of the New Bloom magazine, which focuses on social movements and politics in Taiwan and East Asia. Hioe has written extensively on issues related to democracy, human rights, and political activism, and his work has been featured in various publications, including The Guardian, Al Jazeera, and Nikkei Asian Review.</p>
<p><strong>Me:</strong> Do you mean the author is 丘琦欣? Because, I can't find the word in the article.</p>
<p><strong>ChatGPT:</strong> I apologize for the confusion. It appears that I gave you incorrect information. The author of the article is not Brian Hioe, but rather Chiu Chih-hsien, who is a researcher and expert on political and social issues in Taiwan and China. I apologize for any inconvenience that my previous response may have caused.</p>
<p><strong>Me:</strong> IDK, can you really read the content of the URL? I mean, you cannot browse the internet, but why can you read the article from the URL I provided?</p>
<p><strong>ChatGPT:</strong> I apologize for the confusion. As an AI language model, I don't actually &quot;read&quot; content from URLs or browse the internet. When you provided the URL, I assumed that you wanted me to provide a summary of the article based on my pre-existing knowledge of its content, as I am trained on a large dataset of text, including news articles and other types of content.</p>
<p>However, I must rely on the information that has been provided to me, and sometimes there may be inaccuracies or misunderstandings. If you have any questions or concerns, please feel free to let me know, and I will do my best to provide you with accurate and helpful information.</p>
<p><strong>Me:</strong> So, how do you know the summary when I provided the link? If I give you a link like this: https://udn.com/news/story/6811/6971454, do you know what the article talked about?</p>
<p><strong>ChatGPT:</strong> As an AI language model, I do not have access to the internet, so I am not able to browse the content of the URL you provided or any other website. However, I can provide you with some information about the URL you shared.</p>
<p>The URL you provided (https://udn.com/news/story/6811/6971454) appears to be a link to a news article on the website of United Daily News (UDN), which is a popular news source in Taiwan. Without accessing the article, I am not able to provide a summary of its contents, but if you tell me what you are interested in learning, I can try to provide some relevant information based on my pre-existing knowledge.</p>
<p><strong>Me:</strong> So you can't summarise the link, right? https://udn.com/news/story/6811/6971454</p>
<p><strong>ChatGPT:</strong> That is correct. As an AI language model, I do not have access to the internet, so I am not able to browse the content of the link you provided. I apologize for any confusion that my previous response may have caused. If you have any specific questions or topics that you would like to discuss, I am here to help in any way I can.</p>
<p><strong>Me:</strong> But why do you know the outline when I provide &quot;The URL of the article&quot; I am referring to? How do you split and read the link &quot;https://www.twreporter.org/a/opinion-ccp-100-japan-communist-party&quot;?</p>
<p><strong>ChatGPT:</strong> I apologize for the confusion. I do not actually &quot;read&quot; the link or article when you provide a URL, but rather I use natural language processing algorithms to extract the main topic or content of the article based on its title and other metadata.</p>
<p>When you provided the link &quot;https://www.twreporter.org/a/opinion-ccp-100-japan-communist-party,&quot; my algorithms were able to extract the title of the article (&quot;The CCP Turns 100: What Japan's Communist Party Can Teach Us About Surviving Repression&quot;) and the name of the publication where it was published (The Reporter). Based on this information, I was able to provide a summary of the article's main topic, drawing on my pre-existing knowledge of issues related to politics, repression, and authoritarianism.</p>
<p>However, I do not have access to the full text of the article, and my summary may not capture all of the details or nuances of the original content. If you have any specific questions or topics that you would like me to help with, please let me know.</p>
<p><strong>Me:</strong> So, when I provide &quot;https://www.twreporter.org/a/opinion-ccp-100-japan-communist-party&quot;, you split info some texts: &quot;https://www.twreporter.org&quot;, &quot;/a/&quot;, &quot;opinion&quot;, &quot;ccp-100&quot;, &quot;japan-communist-party&quot;, and find each of keywords in your database, then catch those infos, right?</p>
<p><strong>ChatGPT:</strong> To clarify, I don't actually split the URL into separate texts, but rather I use a natural language processing technique called named entity recognition (NER) to identify and extract specific pieces of information from the URL, such as the domain name (https://www.twreporter.org), the path (/a/opinion-ccp-100-japan-communist-party), and other attributes.</p>
<p>Using this information, I can infer certain things about the content of the article, such as the fact that it was published in the opinion section of the website, and that it pertains to the Chinese Communist Party's 100th anniversary and its implications for political repression and survival.</p>
<p>However, it's important to note that I do not have access to the full text of the article, and my understanding of its content is based on my pre-existing knowledge of the topics and keywords involved. If you have any specific questions or concerns, please feel free to let me know.</p>
<p><strong>Me:</strong> So, if I provide the title of the article of The Reporter one: &quot;野島剛／中共和日共，兩個兄弟共產黨的百年愛恨 - 報導者 The Reporter&quot;, do you know the title of the article?</p>
<p><strong>ChatGPT:</strong> Yes, based on the title you provided, I can see that it is the Chinese version of the article that corresponds to the English-language article with the title &quot;The CCP Turns 100: What Japan's Communist Party Can Teach Us About Surviving Repression.&quot; The Chinese title you provided reads as &quot;野島剛／中共和日共，兩個兄弟共產黨的百年愛恨 - 報導者 The Reporter,&quot; which roughly translates to &quot;Noshima Takeshi / CCP and JCP: A Hundred-Year Story of Love and Hate Between Two Brother Communist Parties - The Reporter.&quot;</p>
<p><strong>Me:</strong> Um, do you really believe that &quot;The CCP Turns 100: What Japan's Communist Party Can Teach Us About Surviving Repression.&quot; and &quot;CCP and JCP: A Hundred-Year Story of Love and Hate Between Two Brother Communist Parties&quot; are talking about the same thing?</p>
<p><strong>ChatGPT:</strong> I apologize for the confusion. It seems that the Chinese and English versions of the article have different titles, and upon further investigation, they appear to be two separate articles that cover related but distinct topics. The Chinese-language article you mentioned, with the title &quot;野島剛／中共和日共，兩個兄弟共產黨的百年愛恨 - 報導者 The Reporter,&quot; covers the history of the Chinese Communist Party (CCP) and its relationship with the Japanese Communist Party (JCP), while the English-language article with the title &quot;The CCP Turns 100: What Japan's Communist Party Can Teach Us About Surviving Repression&quot; explores the lessons that can be drawn from the experience of the JCP for other Communist parties facing repression.I apologize for any confusion my previous response may have caused, and I hope this clarification helps. Please let me know if you have any further questions or concerns.</p>
<p><strong>Me:</strong> And who is Noshima Takeshi?</p>
<p><strong>ChatGPT:</strong> Noshima Takeshi is a Japanese politician who is a member of the Japanese Communist Party (JCP). According to the Chinese-language article you mentioned, Noshima Takeshi has been a member of the JCP for over 50 years and has played an important role in the party's activities and international relations. The article cites some of his views on the relationship between the JCP and the CCP, as well as his thoughts on the significance of the CCP's 100th anniversary.</p>
<h2>Impressions</h2>
<p>Nice try, but answers are unacceptable. Too many factual mistakes:</p>
<ol>
<li>The author of the article <a href="https://www.twreporter.org/a/opinion-ccp-100-japan-communist-party">中共和日共，兩個兄弟共產黨的百年愛恨</a> is <a href="https://nojimatsuyoshi.com">Nojima Tsuyoshi (野島剛, 野嶋剛)</a>, not <a href="https://twitter.com/brianhioe">Brian Hioe</a> ChatGPT insists.</li>
<li>Nojima Tsuyoshi, in which ChatGPT says Noshima Takeshi, is not a Japanese politician but a Japanese journalist.</li>
<li>The original title, &quot;中共和日共，兩個兄弟共產黨的百年愛恨&quot;, is more closed to &quot;CCP and JCP: A Hundred-Year Story of Love and Hate Between Two Brother Communist Parties&quot; ChatGPT later realised. The &quot;The CCP Turns 100: What Japan's Communist Party Can Teach Us About Surviving Repression&quot; title is not even closed.</li>
<li>The article's subject is the relationship between the CCP and the JCP, not about comparisons of the two parties.</li>
</ol>
<p>ChatGPT makes the reason for it very clear: it cannot access the Internet, and its data are outdated. But how can it know my question and try to answer it? Based on the answers, I found an interesting idea: The URL.</p>
<h2>URL, XKCD, and texts</h2>
<p>Based on the chat, ChatGPT can read a URL if it provides a text like <code>https://www.twreporter.org/a/opinion-ccp-100-japan-communist-party</code>. It splits into domain (https://www.twreporter.org) and path (/a/opinion-ccp-100-japan-communist-party) and searches their usages by using <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Named-entity_recognition">named entity recognition (NER)</a>.</p>
<p>When I provide a link like <a href="https://www.twreporter.org/a/opinion-ccp-100-japan-communist-party">https://www.twreporter.org/a/opinion-ccp-100-japan-communist-party</a>, it can generate a wrong but detailed answer; However, if the URL doesn't have any texts like <a href="https://udn.com/news/story/6811/6971454">https://udn.com/news/story/6811/6971454</a>, it cannot understand directly like what it states. Therefore, I assume that ChatGPT knows nothing about URLs with paths shown in numbers.</p>
<p>However, when I give a link about <a href="https://xkcd.com/1/">https://xkcd.com/1/</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>What does the comic is? https://xkcd.com/1/</p>
<p>The comic at https://xkcd.com/1/ is a simple stick figure drawing with the caption &quot;Barrel - Part 1&quot; written above it. The comic depicts a person trying to use a barrel to protect themselves from a potential danger, but the danger turns out to be a simple mouse that the person could easily have dealt with without the barrel. The comic is the first in a series of many more xkcd comics that focus on humor, science, technology, and other topics.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Still erroneous, but it amuses me since ChatGPT knows what the comic is about despite the URL path being just numbers. So I ask <strong>ChatGPT:</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Then... how do you know what https://xkcd.com/1/ is?</p>
<p>I know what https://xkcd.com/1/ is based on my training data. As an AI language model, I have been trained on a large corpus of text, including web pages, books, and other sources of textual information.</p>
<p>During my training, I was exposed to the contents of the xkcd website, including the first comic at https://xkcd.com/1/. Based on the textual information available on the webpage, such as the title and the caption of the comic, I am able to describe the comic and its contents.</p>
<p>However, it's important to note that my understanding of the comic is based solely on the text available on the webpage and not on any visual information that may be present in the comic itself.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Well... Interesting.</p>
<h2>Conslusion</h2>
<p>So, how did ChatGPT &quot;reads&quot; the comic? How can ChatGPT &quot;knows&quot; the subject of articles? By <em>lots</em> of text materials.</p>
<p>If enough people discuss <code>https://xkcd.com/1/</code>, then ChatGPT knows what the comic is about; If enough articles talking the CCP and the JCP, ChatGPT will understand what it is; And, when providing any new articles, ChatGPT makes convincing stories without reading the article.</p>
<p>The conversations inspire my view and understanding of <strong>ChatGPT:</strong> ChatGPT is good at text processing. While ChatGPT may not perfect at providing good answers, it deals with texts well. And that's what ChatGPT is all about.</p>
<p>If you try to puzzle ChatGPT by asking questions, you can definitely do it; But if you try to ask ChatGPT with detailed text contents, it will give you a satisfying outcome.</p>
<p>The more I chat with ChatGPT, the more things I know about it.</p>
<p>Anyway, I want to try <a href="https://aidungeon.io"><em>AI Dungeon</em></a> when seeing it on <a href="https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/AIDungeon2">TV Tropes</a>.</p>
